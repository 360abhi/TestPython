File System:

Everything in a linux os is a file including commands.
All commands files are inside bin folder of the root, we can copy the command and rename it and use that command as a substitute for the original one.
Dev folder in / has the devices. [ vda vda1 sda sda1 are the harddrives]
config, nw files inside the etc folder
media directory: shows the mounted files, like a flash drive
mnt: the drive we manually mount are shown here
users inside /etc/passwd
password for users with x inside /etc/shadow

We use shell to interact with the system, and the terminal emulator interacts with the shell
bash is a shell for linux ,pwsh for windows(powershell)
$ -> user and # -> root

Managing users in Linux – sudo

useradd : lazy user add
adduser: add with all info [get its home dir and bash as shell and a password]
sudo usermod username –shell  /bin/bash - ---> to change the bash of the username
sudo usermod -l newname oldusername  -> to change the username of the user
useradd newuser -m ---> to get the user its home directory by default
sudo passwd user --> to change the password of the user
su - user --> switch user
** not every user can use the sudo command , only in the sudoers file can.
** sudo visudo: edit the sudoers file
sudo userdel user - -> delete the user
sudo groupadd groupname  --.> adds a new group
like users inside etc/passwd groups are inside /etc/group
sudo usermod -aG groupname user  - > add user to the groupname
sudo gpasswd -d user groupname - > del user from the group
sudo groupdel groupname -> deletes the group not the users, so if the group had any permissions they are also lost


Package Management Tools in Linux

apt and dpkg : dpkg is low level package manager which installs tools but not dependencies, we’ve to take care of the dependencies first separately. Also dpkg uses the debian file downloaded while apt uses a repository and fetches the file from there.
Apt update -> first update from the repo then apt install package to get the latest ones
sudo apt edit-sources  -> to look the source of the packages and the repository
sudo apt remove package  -> to remove the package but not the user data
sudo apt purge package -> remove the package as well as the user data
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade --> update and upgrade the packages installed
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -> install the cloned repo tool requirements file
git clone <url> -> clone the url from github to local machine
