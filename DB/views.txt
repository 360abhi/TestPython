âœ… What is a View?
A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.
It does not store data itself, but provides a way to look at data from one or more tables.

Think of a view like a "named SELECT query" that you can use like a table.

| Reason             | Explanation                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”’ **Security**    | Hide sensitive columns by showing only selected data.               |
| ðŸ’¡ **Simplicity**  | Complex joins and queries can be reused easily.                     |
| ðŸ§  **Abstraction** | Provides a cleaner interface to raw data.                           |
| ðŸ”„ **Reusability** | Same query logic used in multiple places.                           |
| ðŸ§¼ **Consistency** | Ensure standardized logic (e.g., salary with grade already joined). |


CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON ...
WHERE condition;

CREATE VIEW emp_details AS
SELECT e.name, e.email, d.dept_name, s.base_salary
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
JOIN salary s ON e.grade = s.grade;

=> Now we can use this on the view
SELECT * FROM emp_details;

high_salary_emps â€“ Filter Only High Earners (Salary > 200000)

CREATE VIEW high_salary_emps AS
SELECT 
    e.name,
    e.grade,
    s.base_salary,
    d.dept_name
FROM 
    employee e
JOIN 
    salary s ON e.grade = s.grade
JOIN 
    department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE 
    s.base_salary > 200000;

DROP VIEW view_name;
