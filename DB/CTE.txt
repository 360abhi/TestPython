üîÅ What Is a Recursive Query?
A recursive query is a query that calls itself to process hierarchical or tree-like data ‚Äî like a manager‚Äìemployee structure, or folder‚Äìsubfolder relationships.

It's done using a CTE (Common Table Expression) with the keyword:
WITH RECURSIVE

CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  manager_id INTEGER
);

emp_id | name     | manager_id
-------|----------|------------
1      | Alice    | NULL
2      | Bob      | 1
3      | Charlie  | 2
4      | David    | 2
5      | Eva      | 3

So:

Alice is the CEO (no manager)
Bob reports to Alice
Charlie and David report to Bob
Eva reports to Charlie
